The `workspace` subpackage provides an interactive interface to ARTS and
can be used to directly call workspace methods and agendas as well as
access and manipulate workspace variables.

Setup
-----

The python interface needs access to the :code:`libarts_api.so` shared library, which
is located in the `src` subfolder of the ARTS build tree. The interface expects
the location of the ARTS build tree to be provided in the ``ARTS_BUILD_PATH``
environment variable. For the :code:`libarts_api.so` to be built, ARTS needs to be
configured with :code:`-DENABLE_C_API=1`:

    cmake -DENABLE_C_API=1 ... /path/to/arts

The Workspace Class
-------------------

The main functionality of the interface is implemented by the Workspace class.
A Workspace object represents an ongoing ARTS simulation and is used to execute
controlfiles and workspace methods and access workspace variables

    from typhon.arts.workspace import Workspace
    ws = Workspace()

Executing Controlfiles
----------------------

Controlfiles can be executed on a workspace using the :code:`execute_controlfile`
method.

    ws.execute_controlfile("general.arts")

The search path for controlfiles is the current directory plus the paths
provided in the environment variable ``ARTS_INCLUDE_PATH``. Controlfiles
are parsed only once and then cached. Thus, if a controlfile is modified
after it has been loaded, these changes will only be effective after a
restart of the python runtime.

Calling Workspace Methods
-------------------------

ARTS workspace methods are available as member functions of each Workspace
object:

    ws.AtmosphereSet1D()
    ws.IndexSet(ws.stokes_dim, 1)

Arguments can be passed to a workspace function in three ways:

    1. As workspace variables using the attributes of the
       workspace object, such as :code:`ws.stokes_dim` in the
       example above.
    2. Using one of the symbolic variables in
       :code:`typhon.arts.workspace.variables`
    3. Passing supported python objects directly

Arguments to a WSM can be passed using either positional or named arguments or both. If
positional arguments are provided at least all generic output and generic input arguments
must be given in order.

    ws.VectorNLogSpace(ws.p_grid, 361, 500e2, 0.1 )

Keyword arguments to define generic input and output arguments. Available keywords are the
names of the generic outputs and inputs defined in methods.cc.

    ws.abs_speciesSet(species=[ "O3" ])

Calls to supergeneric functions are resolved by the interface.

Workspace Variables
-------------------

Symbolic representation of all workspace variables are available in the typhon.arts.workspace.variables
module as module attributes. The purpose of these is to be passed to workspace functions as placeholders
for variables in the workspace.

Variable objects can be associated to a workspace, which is the case for variables accessed as attributes
of a workspace, i.e. using for example:

    ws.y

If that is the case their value can be accessed using the value() member function. In order
to print out a textual representation of the value, the print() member function can be used,
which will call the corresponding Print() ARTS WSV.

Workspace variables of the groups Vector, Matrix and Tensor with an associated workspace
implement the numpy array interface and can therefore be used just as any other numpy array.
In some cases, however, it may be necessary to explicitly create a view on the array using
numpy.asarray.
